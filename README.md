# unlockr-access-control-with-arduino-uno-and-mobile-integration

Project Description:
This project is a automated gate system designed to help persons with disabilities (PWDs) open and close their gates easily. It uses an Arduino Uno to control the gate and a Flutter mobile app to operate it. Instead of struggling with heavy gates, users can simply press a button in the app to open or close the gate remotely. The system works by connecting the Arduino to a hinge that moves the gate. The app communicates with the Arduino through Bluetooth, making it convenient to use. 
Many PWDs struggle to open and close gates because of physical limitations. Traditional gates require manual effort, which can be difficult or impossible for some individuals. While automated gate systems exist, they are often expensive and not designed for PWD accessibility. This project aims to solve this problem by creating an affordable and easy-to-use smart gate system. Using a mobile app and Arduino-uno, PWDs can open or close their gates with a simple tap, making their daily lives more convenient and independent.

 Features:
1. Accessible for PWDs - The system will be specifically designed for persons who are having difficulty with their disabilities on a daily basis. This will aid them to open and close doors easily.
2. Enhanced Security Convenience - It eliminates the need for physical keys and becomes more convenient
3. Simple Design and Integration - The system will be easy to set up, making gate operation hassle-free.
4. Data Logging - The system will record and track the past gates' activity and usage.
