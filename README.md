# unlockr-access-control-with-arduino-uno-and-mobile-integration

This project is a smart gate system designed to help persons with disabilities (PWDs) open and close their gates easily. It uses an Arduino Uno to control the gate and a Flutter mobile app to operate it. Instead of struggling with heavy gates, users can simply press a button in the app to open or close the gate remotely. The system works by connecting the Arduino to a hinge that moves the gate. The app communicates with the Arduino through Bluetooth, making it convenient to use. 

 Features:
1. Accessible for PWDs - The system will be specifically designed for persons who are having difficulty with their disabilities on a daily basis. This will aid them to open and close doors easily.
2. Enhanced Security Convenience - It eliminates the need for physical keys and becomes more convenient
3. Simple Design and Integration - The system will be easy to set up, making gate operation hassle-free.
4. Data Logging - The system will record and track the past gates' activity and usage.
