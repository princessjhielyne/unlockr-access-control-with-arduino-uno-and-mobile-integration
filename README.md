# unlockr-access-control-with-arduino-uno-and-mobile-integration

Project Description:
This project is a automated gate system designed to help persons with disabilities (PWDs) open and close their gates easily. It uses an Arduino Uno to control the gate and a Flutter mobile app to operate it. Instead of struggling with heavy gates, users can simply press a button in the app to open or close the gate remotely. The system works by connecting the Arduino to a hinge that moves the gate. The app communicates with the Arduino through Bluetooth, making it convenient to use. 
Many PWDs struggle to open and close gates because of physical limitations. Traditional gates require manual effort, which can be difficult or impossible for some individuals. While automated gate systems exist, they are often expensive and not designed for PWD accessibility. This project aims to solve this problem by creating an affordable and easy-to-use smart gate system. Using a mobile app and Arduino-uno, PWDs can open or close their gates with a simple tap, making their daily lives more convenient and independent.
